# What Inspired Us

At Live Free or Die Cloud Solutions, we built this suite after years of seeing smart, hardworking people fall through the cracks simply because they didn’t have time to learn apps, manage spreadsheets, or build websites.

We watched vendors scribble appointments in paper notebooks, get paid late, lose customer contact info, and get priced out of tools that were “too much” for what they needed.

So we decided to build something different.

### Real Stories That Sparked Our Mission

- A mobile dog groomer who missed out on business because customers couldn’t book via text.
- A mechanic who handwrote 40 receipts a week.
- A vendor at a flea market who lost a $400 sale because the buyer didn’t have cash and they didn’t accept Venmo.

### Our Promise

We're not trying to impress the tech elite. We’re here to serve the backbone of the economy: local workers, small shops, and people with hustle but not time.

If our tools help one vendor reclaim their weekend or keep the lights on — it’s worth it.

**Live Free or Die.**
